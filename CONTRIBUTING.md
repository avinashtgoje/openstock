# About

First of all, thank you for reading this document and to consider contributing to Open Stock.

Please take a look at the [issues page](https://github.com/lcmeyer37/openstock/issues) to check for new problems that you might find interesting to solve. And if you have a new idea, first discuss it in this page, and check if your proposed changes are relevant to the other contributors and users of this repository. 

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please follow this document as well as you interact with the project.

## Contribution Process

1. Create a fork of the project.
2. Make all the changes on the files of your fork that you find relevant.
3. Ensure any unhelpful or unnecessary files are removed from your fork.
4. Update the README.md on your fork, adding or removing information from it in comparison to the current README.md from  the master branch, and new changes you made on the contents of your fork repository.
5. Create a new Pull Request for the master branch. In case you have permission to merge or commit directly to master, you may do so only with the sign-off of the owner or three other contributors that also have these permissions.

Commands: 
* git add [relevant_files]
* git commit -m "short comment describing the changes made with this commit"
* git push

## Coding conventions

1. Any new files external to the program that are needed to be run by the project during runtime should be added to /rootofjar/outfiles/new_file.new.
2. This project tries to follow the [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style) for indentation.
